    <p>Cost of Crime is not responsible for providing legal advice, and is to be used for the sole purpose of education. While
our database is well researched, it should not be used as legal aid in a real life situation. The purpose of this site is to 
discoruage all illegal activity, and make users aware of the potential consequenses. Laws are constantly changing, and, while
we do our best to provide accurate, updated information, we cannot ensure that all the information provided is accurate. 
Criminal law is incredibly subjective and circumstantial, so the information we provide is merely an estimate of what an 
actual punishment may be.</p>
